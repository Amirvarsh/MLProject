PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR AGRICULTURAL GUIDANCE

# Abstract:
As the world is trending into new technologies and
implementations therefore it is a necessary goal to trend up in
agriculture. Various types of researches have been undergone to
improve crop cultivation. Precision Agriculture (PA) will have an
affected decrease in the cost desired. PA is a farming management
concept based on measuring, and responding to inter and intra-field
changeability in crops. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate
farmers that they can produce a yield in good quantity as well as good
quality.
The most popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithm is Random
Forest (RF) which belongs to the supervised learning technique. It is a
method of joining different classifiers to tackle an unpredictable
problem and to increase the performance of the model. The proposed
method gives an accuracy of 96.5% as compared to existing methods
of Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. Our
algorithm predicts the user, what crop type would be the most suitable
for the selected area by processing the environmental factors with the
trained sub-models of the main of the system.

# PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION 

It has been a major problem to identify what crop to grow, any man has adequate space in the owner’s land.  Not only domestic lands but also for farming lands. 

# SOLUTION 

Our algorithm predicts the user, what crop type would be the most suitable for the selected area by collecting the environmental factors for plant growth and processing them with the trained sub-models of the main of the system. By using our algorithm that we developed , farmers can improve crop production.

# CONCLUSION

The results and analysis section presented the performance evaluation of the Random Forest algorithm, a comparative analysis with other algorithms, and the interpretability of the results. The implications of the findings for agricultural practices were discussed, highlighting the improved crop selection, resource management, climate adaptation, and policy planning.
